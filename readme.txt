Based on Joost de Valk's Blog Metrics plugin, provides author metrics for the last year.

== Description ==

Based on ideas in an [excellent post](http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2007/11/blog-metrics-six-recommendations-for-measuring-your-success.html) by Avinash Kaushik this plugin calculates the following:

* average number of words per post
* average number of comments per post without your own comments
* average number of trackbacks per post
* average number of words used in comments to posts

and it calculates the same data for the last year, and for each author too!

Includes a widget for your sidebar too!
